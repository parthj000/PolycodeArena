**Empowering College Coders Through a Unified Competitive Ecosystem**

---

## 💡 The Problem: Why College Coders Struggle

- **No clear path for DSA:** Students eager to learn Data Structures and Algorithms often feel lost without structured guidance.
- **Lack of community:** Beginners struggle alone, leading to burnout without peer support.
- **Pointless problem-solving:** Platforms like LeetCode feel unrewarding without tangible goals or feedback.
- **No incentives:** Absence of badges, certificates, or leaderboards demotivates learners.
- **Limited mentorship:** Teachers are confined to classes and labs, leaving gaps in continuous learning.
- **Hidden talent:** The TPC Cell struggles to identify skilled students due to lack of transparent performance data.
